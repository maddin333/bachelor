Rough estimates of the total systems and programming resources consumed range as high as 75-80 percent in each category. However, the area has been given little attention in the literature. To analyze the problems in this area a questionnaire was developed and pretested. It was then submitted to 120 organizations. Respondents totaled 69. Responses were analyzed with the {SPSS} statistical package. The results of the analysis indicate that: (1) maintenance and enhancement do consume much of the total resources of systems and programming groups; (2) maintenance and enhancement tend to be viewed by management as at least somewhat more important than new application software development; (3) in maintenance and enhancement, problems of a management orientation tend to be more significant than those of a technical orientation; and (4) user demands for enhancements and extension constitute the most important management problem area.},

Refactoring is one way to reuse and extend a successful software system. This article presents some design tactics that will assist a development team when they choose evolution from an existing software system over building a completely new system from the ground up. Strictly speaking, the refactoring process changes only the internal design of the software. Refactoring does not add any new functionality. However, the goal of refactoring work is to pave the way for the software to be modified and extended more easily. The simplest example of redesign is the creation of simple "wrapper classes" that contain groups of functions extracted from the legacy code. More complex design patterns are also useful when attempting to improve the design. Developers usually divide the redesign work into stages so that each stage can be implemented and tested separately. This article describes a real-world example of this approach that shows how refactoring improved the design of a wireless base station controller product.},

	abstract = {For users of software libraries or public programming interfaces ({APIs}), backward compatibility is a desirable trait. Without compatibility, library users will face increased risk and cost when upgrading their dependencies. In this study, we investigate semantic versioning, a versioning scheme which provides strict rules on major versus minor and patch releases. We analyze seven years of library release history in Maven Central, and contrast version identifiers with actual incompatibilities. We find that around one third of all releases introduce at least one breaking change, and that this figure is the same for minor and major releases, indicating that version numbers do not provide developers with information in stability of interfaces. Additionally, we find that the adherence to semantic versioning principles has only marginally increased over time. We also investigate the use of deprecation tags and find out that methods get deleted without applying deprecated tags, and methods with deprecated tags are never deleted. We conclude the paper by arguing that the adherence to semantic versioning principles should increase because it provides users of an interface with a way to determine the amount of rework that is expected when upgrading to a new version.},

	abstract = {The semantic versioning (semver) policy is commonly accepted by open source package management systems to inform whether new releases of software packages introduce possibly backward incompatible changes. Maintainers depending on such packages can use this information to avoid or reduce the risk of breaking changes in their own packages by specifying version constraints on their dependencies. Depending on the amount of control a package maintainer desires to have over her package dependencies, these constraints can range from very permissive to very restrictive. This article empirically compares semver compliance of four software packaging ecosystems (Cargo, npm, Packagist and Rubygems), and studies how this compliance evolves over time. We explore to what extent ecosystem-specific characteristics or policies influence the degree of compliance. We also propose an evaluation based on the "wisdom of the crowds" principle to help package maintainers decide which type of version constraints they should impose on their dependencies.},
